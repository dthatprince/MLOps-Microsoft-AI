# Microsoft Learn AI Skills Challengeâ€¯ - MLOps-Microsoft-AI
Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) Challenge Machine learning operations (MLOps) applies DevOps principles to machine learning projects. You'll learn how to implement key concepts like source control, automation, and CI/CD to build an end-to-end MLOps solution while using Python to train, save, and use a machine learning model.
